Learning Resources:
Documentation
•	Official Python 3 Documentation - "official"/technical explanation of what a particular function/operator does, examples of correct syntax, what the various libraries are, etc.
Textbooks/Tutorials
•	Dive Into Python - another survey of Python syntax, datatypes, etc.
•	Think Python by Allen Downey - a good general overview of the Python language. Includes exercises.
•	The Official Python Tutorial - self-explanatory

Debugging
•	Python Tutor - an excellent way to actually visualize how the interpreter actually reads and executes your code
•	DiffChecker - compares two sets of text and shows you which lines are different
•	Debugging in Python - steps you can take to try to debug your program
Software

More practice problems
•	Python Challenge - a series of puzzles you can try to test your Python abilities
•	Project Euler - additional programming challenges you can try once your Python knowledge becomes stronger; problems are sorted by increasing difficulty
•	Coding Bat - problems you can solve within an online interpreter
•	Codewars - improve your skills by training on real code challenges
