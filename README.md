# MIS3640

This is a public repository for 2016 Fall MIS3640 (PROBLEM SOLVING & SOFTWARE DESIGN). Here You can find all the python files for demo in class. 

## Learning Resources:
### Documentation

- Official Python 3 Documentation (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html>): "official"/technical explanation of what a particular function/operator does, examples of correct syntax, what the various libraries are, etc.
- Reserved Keywords in Python (<https://docs.python.org/3.0/reference/lexical_analysis.html#id8>): don't use these as variable names.
- PEP 8 (<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>): Style Guide for Python Code: learn what is good and bad style in Python.

### Textbooks/Tutorials
- Dive Into Python (<http://www.diveintopython3.net/>): another survey of Python syntax, datatypes, etc.
- The Official Python Tutorial (<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>): self-explanatory.
- Learn Python the Hard Way (<http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>): (note: for Python 2) another free online text.
- Think Python (<http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/>): by Allen Downey. This book offers a very "computer science"-style introduction to Python. 
- Python for You and Me (<http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>): Simple and clear. This is a great book for absolute newcomers, or to keep as a quick reference as you get used to the language. The latest version is Python 3.
- Python 101 (<http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2014/06/03/python-101-book-published-today/>) Available as a reasonably priced ebook. This is a new one from a popular Blogger about Python. Lots of practical examples. 
- Python Essential Reference (<http://www.dabeaz.com/per.html>): The definitive reference for both Python and much of the standard library.
- Hitchhikers Guide to Python (<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest>): Under active development, and still somewhat incomplete, but there is good stuff.
- Writing Idiomatic Python (<https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook>): Focused on not just getting the code to work, but how to write it in a really "Pythonic" way.
- Fluent Python (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do>): All python3, and focused on getting the advanced details right. Good place to go once you've got the basics down.
- CheckIO (<https://checkio.org/>): learn Python by exploring a game world
- Invent with Python (<https://inventwithpython.com/>): develop your Python skills by making games or hacking ciphers.
- Codecademy (<https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python>): (note: for Python 2) learn Python by building web apps and manipulating data; interactive tutorial sequence.
- Python Tutor (<http://www.pythontutor.com/>): interactive tutorial sequence of exercises.
- Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures (<http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html>): Links to an external site.
- Python Course (http://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php>): Links to an external site.

### Debugging
- Python Tutor (<http://www.pythontutor.com/>): an excellent way to actually visualize how the interpreter actually reads and executes your code.
- DiffChecker (<https://www.diffchecker.com/>): compares two sets of text and shows you which lines are different.
- Debugging in Python (<https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/>): steps you can take to try to debug your program.

### Other Q&A
- Stack Overflow (<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python>): a large Q&A forum for programming concepts (not just Python). Try searching here before you post on the edX forum, and you may find that someone has already answered your question.

### More practice problems
- Python Challenge (<http://www.pythonchallenge.com/>): a series of puzzles you can try to test your Python abilities.
- Project Euler (<https://projecteuler.net/>): additional programming challenges you can try once your Python knowledge becomes stronger; problems are sorted by increasing difficulty.
- Coding Bat (<http://codingbat.com/python>): problems you can solve within an online interpreter.
- Codewars (<https://www.codewars.com/?language=python>): improve your skills by training on real code challenges.
